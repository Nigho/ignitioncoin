:::: Upgrading on Ubuntu / Debian Linux Distributions ::::

Your default data directory is ~/.Brewhaust - This folder contains your wallet*, the chain data, and your configuration files
To backup and clean this folder, do this:
`cd ~/.Brewhaust`

You will now be in the data directory. From here, you want to copy out your wallet and important files.
First, make a backup folder,
`mkdir ~/brewhaustbackup`

Then, copy the important files to your backup:
`cp wallet.dat ~/brewhaustbackup && cp *.conf ~/brewhaustbackup`

Now, you can delete the data directory,
`cd ~/ && rm -r ~/.Brewhaust`

The folder that contained your data is now deleted. Now, you can compile BrewhaustCoin like usual,
`mkdir ~/brewhaustcoinsource && cd ~/brewhaustcoinsource && git clone https://github.com/brewhaustcoin/brewhaustcoin && cd brewhaustcoin/src && make -f makefile.unix`

Then, you want to copy your compiled brewhaustd from ~/brewhaustcoinsource/brewhaustcoin/bin to /usr/local/bin, make sure you remove it if it was already there first, by doing:
`sudo rm /usr/local/bin/brewhaustd && cp ~/brewhaustcoinsource/brewhaustcoin/bin/brewhaustd /usr/local/bin`

Once it is compiled and installed, you can then restore the data directory. Run brewhaustd to initialize the directory,
`brewhaustd`

Then, copy the backed up wallet and configuration files into the new data directory, with:
`cp ~/brewhaustbackup/* ~/.Brewhaust`

Now, run brewhaustd again, and your all set , with old wallet and configurations. Just wait for sync and your upgraded!
